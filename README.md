# Language-Based Audio Retrieval — DCASE 2024 Task 8

**Emil Parikh, Liam Wintz, Lai Ye**

This repository contains our implementation of modifications to the [Primus SALSA baseline](https://github.com/OptimusPrimus/salsa) for [DCASE 2024 Task 8: Language-Based Audio Retrieval](https://dcase.community/challenge2024/task-language-based-audio-retrieval). Given a natural language text query, the system retrieves and ranks 10 audio clips from the ClothoV2 dataset by similarity to the query.

Our modifications include a **post-PaSST gated cross-attention aggregation** module and a **Room Impulse Response (RIR) data augmentation** pipeline, both described in the accompanying report.

## Our Modifications

### 1. Gated Cross-Attention (`experiments/ex_dcase24.py`)

The key architectural change is in `forward_audio`. The default Primus implementation mean pools the 189 PaSST patch tokens `(B, 189, 768)` into a single vector `(B, 768)`. We replace this with a gated combination of mean pooling and cross-attention:

- The learned `audio_token` parameter `(B, 1, 768)` acts as a query over the 189 patch tokens as keys and values via `nn.MultiheadAttention(768, 8)`
- A scalar gate `g = sigmoid(Linear(768, 1) * mean_pooled + b)` blends the two outputs
- The bias is initialized to `-3.0` so mean pooling dominates early in training (`g ≈ 0.047`)
- Activated via config: `audio_features.aggregate=weighted_single`

### 2. RIR Data Augmentation (`data/datasets/clotho_v2.py`)

An augmentation class that convolves ClothoV2 clips with random Room Impulse Responses from the [OpenSLR SLR28](https://www.openslr.org/28/) dataset (60,000 simulated small/medium/large room RIRs). During training the augmented dataset is concatenated with the original ClothoV2, doubling the training set size.
